# jersey-authentication-service

Instead of using Java EE or Spring there is a smart way to do similar things. Especially if you try to create a small backend that requires only a few features.

This project contains:
- token based authentication
- registration
- activation
- authorization

Each layer is tested and covered by unit and acceptance tests.
